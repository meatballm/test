overtime most things fade away isn't that right?
all of the memories dissolve it all
the sunshine the breeze's song go by

no matter how big it is it's time will come
it will be reborn as something new
the full moon bright balloon

only my feeling is ever grow
an off-season swallow
so that's me
spring time syndrom
i will follow you
wherever you go
i can't wait to
catch up before the sun sleep
not if your short of breath
i'm the disaster of passion
